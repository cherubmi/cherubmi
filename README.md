<p><b>if</b> you've read through my <i>interests, dni, and byf</i> and wanna to be friends with me for whatever reason, feel free to come up and say hi to me !! i am usually just on here with <a href="https://github.com/draugrism">my lord</a> & so i don't often interact first, but there's no need to be shy- i don't bite !! (usually <3 /j)</p>

<p><b>i am not</b> against <i>touch triggers or discomforts.</i> if you have one, you are entirely safe with me, and if you are against this i would rather not interact with you. also, if you want systems to 'dni' you're disgusting. please educate yourself and stay away from me. thank you !! ۰࿐·˚</p>
